Welcome to my ***DSA in Java*** repository! ðŸš€ This is where I embark on an exciting journey to master ***Data Structures and Algorithms*** using Java. The goal? To build a solid problem-solving foundation and ace coding interviews while enjoying the process! ðŸŽ¯  

 ðŸ“š My Resources  
I'm leveraging the best resources out there to guide me:  
- ***Coding Shuttle***: A structured DSA course that simplifies complex concepts.  
- ***Kunal Kushwaha's Tutorials***: For in-depth explanations and real-world coding insights.  
- ***A2Z Striver DSA Sheet***: A comprehensive roadmap for practicing problems of all difficulty levels.  

 ðŸŒŸ What to Expect  
- ***Code Implementations***: Each problem will have clean, well-commented Java code.  
- ***Variety of Topics***: From arrays and recursion to graphs and dynamic programming, you'll find it all.  
- ***Consistency***: Regular updates to ensure steady progress.  

This repository is my digital notebook, but itâ€™s open to everyone. Whether you're learning alongside me or just passing through for inspiration, I hope it adds value to your DSA journey. Feel free to explore, raise issues, or contribute suggestions.  

***Letâ€™s code our way to greatness! ðŸ’»âœ¨***
